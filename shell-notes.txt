# This file contains a list of shell commands that I've found handy in situations
# I've faced over time. These are commands that _I_ have used (successfully).
# I'm not claiming that this is the only way or even the right
# way to handle a particular situation that you may face. YMMV.

# The commands are ordered by type rather than difficulty, so you are going to
# find intermediate and slightly advanced commands intermingled with the easy
# ones. I mean for this document to be used as a cheat-sheet, not a tutorial,
# but if you are confused about something shoot me a mail

* Redirection
  - some_cmd > some_file 2>&1 &
    # ^ How do I redirect the output of a process to a log file, and
    # background the process at the same time?
