# This file contains a list of java/jvm commands that I've found handy
# in situations I've faced over time. These are commands that _I_ have
# used (successfully).  I'm not claiming that this is the only way or
# even the right way to handle a particular situation that you may
# face. YMMV.


* Basics

** Print Java processes running on the system

$ jps

** Take thread-dumps of a given process

$ sudo jstack -F <pid> > /tmp/threaddump

** Take heap dumps of a given process

$ jmap -dump:format=b,file=cheap.bin <pid>

* Debugging

** Print the values of all the flags for the JVM.

# This will print the default values of all flags.
$ java -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal

# Choose your flags and run the command again, check diff to see all
# the stuff that changes because of your change.
$ java -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC

* GC Tuning
** Thumb Rules of GC Tuning

1. Try to maximize objects reclaimed in young gen. Minimize Full GC
   frequency.
2. Set -Xms and -Xmx to 3x to 4x of LDS.
3. Set both -XX:PermSize and -XX:MaxPermSize to 1.5x max perm gen size.
4. Young gen should be 1.5x of LDS. (around 1/3 - 1/4 of heap size)
   (use -XX:NewRatio to set ratio of young gen to heap size)
5. Old gen should be 2x to 3x of LDS.
6. Which garbage collector should I use?

** Enable GC Logging in production for better insights.

$ java -Xloggc:<file> -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation -XX:+NumberOfGCLogFiles=5 -XX:+GCLogFileSize=10M

** Use [[https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer][GCViewer]] for offline analysis of GC logs.

** Calculate Live Data Size (LDS) to see which objects are being instantiated.

$ jmap -histo:live <pid>

# GC Log will also give approximation on LDS (Heap occupancy after
# each full GC), max perm gen size, and worst case latency scenario
# due to full GC
** Parallel Scavenge GC
- Default in JDK 6, stop-the-world GC
- -XX:+UseParallelGC (for new gen)
- -XX:+UseParallelOldGC (for old gen)
- By default, GC threads = number of cores.
  Control number using -XX:+ParallelGCThreads=<n>
** Concurrent Mark and Sweep GC
- Low latencies collector, very small stop-the-world (for initial
  marking)
- to improve throughput, use ParNewGC for young gen
  -XX:+UseParNewGC (and -XX:+ParallelGCThreads=<n>)
  (CMS will run on old gen and parnew on new gen, so there will be a
  small pause for new gen objects)
- CMS with ParNewGC is a good option for availability
** G1 GC (The Garbage First GC)
- officially supported from JDK 7u4
- -XX:+UseG1GC
- This is replacement for CMS.
  - parallel
  - concurrent
  - generational
  - good throughput
  - low latency
  ** Differences with CMS begin here **
  - compacting
  - predictable
  - improved ease-of-use
- G1GC is great for:
  - Large heaps with limited GC latencies (typically 6GB or larger)
  - Varied object allocation rate, and undesired long GC/compaction
    pauses (> 0.5s)
